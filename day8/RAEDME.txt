•	Day 8: AWS Glue & Data Quality
o	Glue Data Catalog setup , Glue Crawlers: schema discovery, scheduling
o	Glue ETL jobs: visual and script-based
o	AWS Glue Data Quality rules
•	Great Expectations framework
•	Data profiling and validation
•	Quality monitoring and alerting
o	Quality rules as governance artifacts:
•	Who defines quality rules? (Stewards + Owners)
•	How are rules versioned and approved?
•	What happens when quality fails? (Block? Alert? Manual review?)
o	MDM in ETL:
•	Reference data validation
•	Master data enrichment
•	Orphan detection
•	SCD implementation in Glue
o	Quality dimensions mapped to business impact:
•	Completeness → Can we fulfill orders?
•	Accuracy → Are we billing correctly?
•	Timeliness → Are decisions based on current data?
•	Consistency → Do systems agree on customer address?

o	Hands-on:
•	Create Glue crawlers and catalog
•	Build ETL job: CSV to Parquet with quality gates
•	Implement data quality checks with business-rule documentation
•	Validate transaction data against master tables (referential integrity)
•	Create quality scorecard with governance context: 
•	Quality dimension → Business metric → Owner → Threshold → Action on failure
